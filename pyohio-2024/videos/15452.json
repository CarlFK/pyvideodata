  "description": "After creating a great web app using Python such as with flask, the next hurdle to production is how to make it available to users and operate it. And not just your app, but also ingress, the database, observability and the list goes on. We will go through your options for simplifying the operations of your web app using open source tooling. This will include using k8s directly, helm charts, IaaC using pulumi and new tooling developed by Canonical using juju. By the end of the talk you will have seen the benefits and drawbacks of each which will help you make an informed decision on which tool best suits your needs!",
