  "description": "Vector\\-Symbolic Architectures (a.k.a. Hyperdimensional Computing) is a relatively new computational paradigm that involves the use of random vectors in a high\\-dimensional space to represent and process information. As a computational paradigm, it finds applications in a wide range of fields, including artificial intelligence, natural language processing, internet\\-of\\-things, robotics, bioinformatics, and other scientific domains.\r\n\r\nHere we are going to introduce some fundamental concepts at the base of Hyperdimensional Computing, following a presentation of *hdlib*, a library for building Vector\\-Symbolic Architectures with Python. Finally, we are going to see how to easily build a machine learning model based on the Hyperdimensional Computing paradigm as a practical use case.\r\n\r\nAs a reference, *hdlib* is open\\-source, it is available on GitHub at [https://github.com/cumbof/hdlib](https://github.com/cumbof/hdlib), and it is published on the Journal of Open Source Software at [[https://doi.org/10\\.21105/joss.05704](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.05704)](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.05704).",
