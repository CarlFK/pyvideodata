  "description": "Data science and Agile aren't famous for getting along. Data scientists complain that Agile frameworks are too restrictive and deadline\\-focused to accommodate the type of work they do. Scrum masters and product owners have a hard timing planning around unclear timelines and uncertain outcomes, and wish the data scientists would just tell them how much effort a task will take.\r\n\r\nBut it doesn't have to be this way! Data science and Agile can work together to create a better system for everyone. In this talk I'll highlight tips and pitfalls from my own experience, as well as stories I've heard from my colleagues.",
