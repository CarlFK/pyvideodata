  "description": "Generators and Iterators are two core features of Python that are often misunderstood and overlooked. And yet they are extremely powerful and expressive parts of the language. They can be especially useful in data processing, systems integration, or in projects with limited resources. In this talk, we'll get into the fundamentals of what iterators and generators actually are, how they're different from one another, and how they work under the hood. We will explore how to create your own custom iterators and generators for use in your own projects. Throughout the discussion, we'll make comparisons to the simple children's game \"Snakes \\& Ladders,\" and by the end of the talk we should have a simple working example of the game built with iterators and generators.",
