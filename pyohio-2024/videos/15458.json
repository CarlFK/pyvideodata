  "description": "Have you seen `pathlib`? If not, once I show you, you will never go back to string paths and `os.path` ever again! `pathlib` turns paths into path objects, which have attributes and methods that cover a number of operations. In this talk, we will:\r\n\r\n* Talk about how to create `Path` objects, and how this differs on Windows vs Mac/Linux\r\n* Talk about the many properties of pure paths\r\n* Talk about folder operations from `Path` objects, such as creating directory structures and recursive globbing.\r\n* Talk about file operations, made simpler with `Path` objects, such as reading contents, getting properties like file size, and deleting.\r\n\r\nStop messing with string paths and get with `pathlib`!",
